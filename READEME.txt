Can use git clone https://github.com/EffiBello/Helfy-test.git

- First, please copy the helfy_db-script and paste&run it on your local MySQL workbench in order to create the database,tables,and records.
- php artisan serve -> command to run the server (the server will connect automaticlly to the db).
- login & dashboard pages are inside resources/views folder, the assets (images) and css files are inside the public folder.
- The server logic is inside routes/web.
- There might be a slight diffrence between the fontawesome icons in the screen1.png because of difference in versions (i tried my best to find them all :)).
- The helfy_db contains only 1 user -> username: effibello, password:123456!
